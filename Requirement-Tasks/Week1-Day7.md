✅ Week 1 – Day 7: Manual Testing, Code Cleanup & Documentation Update
🎯 Objective
Test all Job CRUD endpoints, ensure DB operations are successful, verify consistent structure across files, and update documentation with endpoint references and usage instructions.

📌 Task 1: Full Manual Testing (CRUD Flow)
Type: QA / Validation
Priority: Highest
Time Estimate: 30–45 min

✅ To-Do:
 Start server:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
 Open Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs

 Run full CRUD test cases:

 POST /jobs: create 2–3 job entries with different statuses

 GET /jobs: should list all jobs, sorted by applied_date

 GET /jobs/{id}: test valid + invalid job IDs

 PUT /jobs/{id}: change title and status

 DELETE /jobs/{id}: delete 1 job, then confirm via GET

 Confirm:

 Status codes are correct: 201, 200, 204, 404

 Error messages are meaningful

 No unhandled exceptions

 Deleted job no longer appears

📌 Task 2: Code Cleanup & Consistency
Type: Maintenance
Priority: High
Time Estimate: 20–30 min

✅ To-Do:
 Check file structure:

pgsql
Copy
Edit

├── sql/
│   ├── crud.py
│   ├── database.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── schemas.py
└── app/
    └── main.py
 Confirm:

 sql only contains data/model logic

 services only contains business logic

 routes only contains endpoint definitions

 Remove:

 Unused imports

 Temporary print/log statements

 TODO comments for completed items

 Commit:
