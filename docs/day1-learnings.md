fast api design - 
It’s built to handle a lot of users at once using Python's async features — perfect for modern web apps and APIs.
The framework is minimal but powerful. You can create working endpoints with just a few lines of clean code.
FastAPI uses Starlette (for performance) and Pydantic (for data handling), so you’re not reinventing the wheel — you're building on top of battle-tested tools
If you know Python, you’ll feel right at home. Writing routes and handling data feels very natural.

AUTO DOCUMENTATION
As soon as you write your API code, FastAPI builds interactive docs for you — no extra work needeed.
Since the docs are generated from your code, they always reflect the current state of your API
FastAPI uses OpenAPI, which means you can easily generate client SDKs or use tools like Swagger.

TYPE HINTING AND VALIDATION
You tell it what kind of data you expect (like int or str) and it makes sure incoming requests follow those rules.
If someone sends the wrong kind of data, FastAPI returns a clear error message without crashing your app.

You write less code to check data — FastAPI and Pydantic do that for you behind the scenes.
Since you're using type hints, your code editor gives you autocomplete, suggestions, and catches mistakes while typing.
You can define models (using Pydantic) once and use them across multiple endpoints — super helpful for consistency.
You’re building APIs with the confidence that your inputs are well-structured, and the docs are already written for you.
